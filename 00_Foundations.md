**Basics of Prompt Engineering**

Prompt Engineering is the art and science of crafting inputs (prompts) for large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini to get the best possible outputs. Think of it as giving very clear instructions to an AI so it understands exactly what you want.
The better the prompt, the more accurate, relevant, and actionable the response will be. Poorly phrased prompts can lead to vague, off-topic, or incorrect answers.
Prompt engineering is essential for ethical hacking, cybersecurity research, and automation because it helps you instruct AI models to generate precise outputs safely and efficiently.

**What is a Prompt?**

A prompt is the text, question, or instruction you give to an AI model to generate a response. It can be as simple as a question or as complex as a multi-step instruction.

**Examples of prompts:**

“List the top 5 cybersecurity threats in 2025.”
“Generate a phishing awareness email for employees.”
“Summarize this vulnerability report in 3 bullet points.”

Prompts can also include:

Role instructions: “Act as a penetration tester…”
Context: “Given a web application with login flaws…”
Output format: “Provide the answer in a JSON table.”

**Accessing LLMs**

To practice prompt engineering, you need access to LLMs. Some popular options:
ChatGPT (OpenAI) – Widely used, supports GPT-4 and GPT-4o models. Accessible via web, API, or integrated tools.
Claude (Anthropic) – Focuses on safety and structured reasoning. Great for multi-step tasks.
Gemini (Google DeepMind) – Known for long-context understanding and creative responses.

**Tips for beginners:**

Start with free-tier web access to experiment.
Later, use APIs to automate prompts or integrate AI into scripts and tools.
Always note the model version and context length to optimize results.


**First Prompts: Practice Examples**

Before diving into advanced hacking prompts, it’s important to get hands-on with general examples:

**Example 1 – Movie Recommendation**
Prompt: “Recommend 5 thriller movies released in the last 5 years. Include a short 2-sentence summary for each.”


**Example 2 – Training Plan**
Prompt: “Create a 4-week beginner workout plan for strength and endurance. Include 3 sessions per week and rest days.”


**Example 3 – Summarizing Text**
Prompt: “Summarize the following text in 3 bullet points for a non-technical audience.”

These examples help you understand how clarity, context, and instructions affect the AI output.

**Summary**

Prompt engineering is about writing clear, precise instructions for AI.
A prompt is the instruction or query you give to an LLM.
Start with simple examples to practice and understand how prompts affect responses.
Access different LLMs (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini) to see model-specific behavior.
By mastering foundations, you’ll be ready to use prompts for ethical hacking and cybersecurity applications safely and effectively.
