What is Prompt Engineering?

Prompt Engineering is the art of crafting instructions for AI to get the most accurate and useful outputs.

Accessing LLMs

ChatGPT (OpenAI)

Claude (Anthropic)

Gemini (Google)

What is a Prompt?

A prompt is a direct instruction or question you give an AI.
Example:

Task: Identify top 5 vulnerabilities in a WordPress site
Role: Ethical Hacker
Output: Short, actionable list

Basic Techniques

Simple prompts to obtain information

Summarizing & structuring data

Generating creative text

Working with numbers and calculations

Multilingual prompts

Practice: Try one prompt daily and review AI output.

Prompt Engineering Frameworks

Here are 10 frameworks to structure your prompts:

Framework	Description	Example
RACE	Role – Action – Context – Explanation	Role: Hacker, Action: Scan, Context: WordPress, Explanation: List vulnerabilities
CARE	Context – Action – Result – Example	Context: Web App, Action: Check security, Result: Report, Example: CVE list
APE	Action – Purpose – Execution	Action: Enumerate subdomains, Purpose: Recon, Execution: Table output
CREATE	Character – Request – Examples – Adjustment – Type – Extras	Character: Security Analyst, Request: Phishing template, Examples: Safe, Adjustment: Concise, Type: Table, Extras: Notes
TAG	Task – Action – Goal	Task: Vulnerability scan, Action: Identify flaws, Goal: Prioritized report
CREO	Context – Request – Explanation – Outcome	Context: Email security, Request: Generate phishing examples, Explanation: Ethical test, Outcome: Training material
RISE	Role – Input – Steps – Execution	Role: Red Team, Input: Target IP, Steps: Scan > Enumerate > Report, Execution: Markdown report
PAIN	Problem – Action – Information – Next Steps	Problem: Weak passwords, Action: Check, Info: Report vulnerabilities, Next Steps: Recommend
COAST	Context – Objective – Actions – Scenario – Task	Context: Web app, Objective: Security audit, Actions: Scan, Report, Scenario: Live testing, Task: Document
ROSES	Role – Objective – Scenario – Expected solution – Steps	Role: Security Analyst, Objective: Mitigation, Scenario: WordPress site, Expected solution: Patch list, Steps: Step-by-step

Practice: Apply one framework every day to a small example.

Advanced Prompting Techniques

Mimicking roles/personas – attacker vs defender

Few-shot learning – provide small examples for better AI output

Assigning numerical values – risk scoring

Arranging elements – tables, lists, hierarchies

Step-by-step reasoning (CoT) – chain-of-thought prompts

Ethical Hacking with Prompts

Reconnaissance – whois, OSINT, subdomain mapping

Summarizing vulnerability scans

Ethical phishing templates – awareness training

Payload variations – safely generate testing payloads

Multilingual OSINT – global scope

Advanced Techniques:

Role-based attacker/defender simulation

Few-shot exploit patterns

Risk scoring logs and alerts

Attack chain mapping (MITRE ATT&CK)

Step-by-step exploit reasoning

Use Cases & Applications

Security policies and compliance

Cybersecurity education and labs

SOC communication (incident reporting, phishing analysis)

Automating log & SIEM summaries

Enterprise AI: Red Team & Blue Team integration
