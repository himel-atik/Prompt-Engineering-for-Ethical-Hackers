# Foundations

**Basics of Prompt Engineering**

Prompt Engineering is the art and science of crafting inputs (prompts) for large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini to get the best possible outputs. Think of it as giving very clear instructions to an AI so it understands exactly what you want. The better the prompt, the more accurate, relevant, and actionable the response will be. Poorly phrased prompts can lead to vague, off-topic, or incorrect answers. Prompt engineering is essential for ethical hacking, cybersecurity research, and automation because it helps you instruct AI models to generate precise outputs safely and efficiently.

**What is a Prompt?**

A prompt is the text, question, or instruction you give to an AI model to generate a response. It can be as simple as a question or as complex as a multi-step instruction.

**Examples of prompts:**

`“List the top 5 cybersecurity threats in 2025.” “Generate a phishing awareness email for employees.” “Summarize this vulnerability report in 3 bullet points.”`

**Prompts can also include:**

Role instructions: `“Act as a penetration tester…” Context: “Given a web application with login flaws…” Output format: “Provide the answer in a JSON table.”`

**Accessing LLMs**

To practice prompt engineering, you need access to LLMs. Some popular options: ChatGPT (OpenAI) – Widely used, supports GPT-4 and GPT-4o models. Accessible via web, API, or integrated tools. Claude (Anthropic) – Focuses on safety and structured reasoning. Great for multi-step tasks. Gemini (Google DeepMind) – Known for long-context understanding and creative responses.

**Tips for beginners:**

Start with free-tier web access to experiment. Later, use APIs to automate prompts or integrate AI into scripts and tools. Always note the model version and context length to optimize results.

**First Prompts: Practice Examples**

Before diving into advanced hacking prompts, it’s important to get hands-on with general examples:

Example 1 – Movie Recommendation Prompt: `“Recommend 5 thriller movies released in the last 5 years. Include a short 2-sentence summary for each.”`

Example 2 – Training Plan Prompt: `“Create a 4-week beginner workout plan for strength and endurance. Include 3 sessions per week and rest days.”`

Example 3 – Summarizing Text Prompt: `“Summarize the following text in 3 bullet points for a non-technical audience.”`

These examples help you understand how clarity, context, and instructions affect the AI output.

**Summary**

Prompt engineering is about writing clear, precise instructions for AI. A prompt is the instruction or query you give to an LLM. Start with simple examples to practice and understand how prompts affect responses. Access different LLMs (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini) to see model-specific behavior. By mastering foundations, you’ll be ready to use prompts for ethical hacking and cybersecurity applications safely and effectively.


# Basic-Techniques

Once you understand the foundations of prompt engineering, it’s time to learn how to craft effective prompts to get accurate and actionable outputs. These are essential techniques for beginners and ethical hackers alike.

**1. Simple Prompts to Obtain Information**

The most basic use of prompts is to ask for information directly. Keep your prompt clear and specific.

Examples:

`“List the top 5 cybersecurity threats in 2025.”`

`“What are the common methods of phishing attacks?”`

`“Explain SQL injection in simple terms.”`

**Tips:**
Use direct questions.
Avoid vague terms like “Tell me something about…”
Specify format if needed: `“List as bullet points,” or “Explain in one paragraph.”`

**2. Summarizing and Structuring Information**

AI can help you condense long documents or organize data.

**Examples:**

`“Summarize this vulnerability report in 5 bullet points.”`

`“Convert this security policy into a checklist for employees.”`

`“Summarize this incident report in a table with columns: Date, Threat, Action Taken.”`

**Tips:**
Provide context for better summarization.
Use output instructions like table, bullet points, or numbered lists.

**3. Generating Artistic or Creative Text**

Even in cybersecurity, AI can help you create engaging content, e.g., phishing awareness campaigns, educational content, or security posters.

Examples:

`“Write a short story about a hacker who learns ethical hacking.”`

`“Generate a catchy security awareness slogan for employees.”`

**Tips:**
Mention tone: formal, humorous, or serious.
Specify audience to make content relevant.

**4. Seeking Numerical Data and Transforming It**

You can ask AI to extract, calculate, or manipulate numbers from data.

Examples:

`“List the top 5 countries with the highest cybercrime rates.”`

`“Convert the following log times from UTC to local timezone.”`

**Tips:**
Clearly specify the data type and transformation rules.
Ask for structured output: table, JSON, or list.

**5. Working with Different Languages**

LLMs can handle multiple languages. You can translate prompts or outputs or generate content in different languages.

Examples:

`“Translate this cybersecurity guide into Bengali.”`

`“Explain phishing attacks in simple Spanish.”`

**Tips:**
Specify language clearly.
Provide context for better accuracy.

**Summary**
Keep prompts clear and specific.
Use direct questions for information.
Specify output formats.
Use prompts creatively for education and awareness.

Leverage multi-language capabilities.

✅ Exercise: Try creating 5 prompts for each technique using real-life cybersecurity examples. For instance, summarize a recent vulnerability report or generate a phishing awareness slogan.
